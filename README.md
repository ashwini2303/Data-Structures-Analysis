# Data-Structures-Analysis

String is a sequence of characters enclosed within single quotes (' ') or double quotes (" "). They are immutable, so once a string is created, it cannot be altered. Strings can contain letters, numbers, and special characters, and they support a wide range of operations such as slicing, concatenation, etc.
Note: As strings are immutable, modifying a string will result in creating a new copy
